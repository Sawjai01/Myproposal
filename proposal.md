# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Tetris game or a connect four game.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Tetris game: Creates a 1 player game where maniplute the piece of the shapes ( tetriminoes ) on the bottom of a rectangular grid and filling it. As you fill up the spaces, you level up and the pace of the game gets faster. 
Connect four game: A 2 players game competing in a 6x7 grid board. Both players will need to have 4 pieces either horizontally or vertically to be delcared as a winner. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Tetris game: using pygame for grahpical endering and user interface > using game loops > loops > manipluating the tetris (4 blocks each pieces) (rotate), > scoring system, score checking, allows players to keep track with their score> level up, players level up by their score points, each lvl increases the speed of the game > a interface with a start, pause, play again, and game over screen display > images and sound effects.
Connect four game: using pygame for graphical interface > create 6x7 retanglur grid > Software that checks which player won in successfully haveing connected 4 pieces : horizontally/vertically > will run in game loops until a player wins or ends with a draw 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Working alone. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I will try to accomplish a adquate amount of code. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

 The better outcome I think I can accomplish before the projects deadline, is probably doing intense research/help from outside resources and most likely try to be more creative. 
 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome I can possible hope to accomplish before the final project is due, is probably if I have time to make sure the code will work, as I am working alone in this project. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
 My skills I will need to acquire is spending more time practing the code and with researchiing on how-to do it / try to be more creative on my part.
